## Introduction
This repository holds code used to analyze the data produced in
the BNL DUNE tests of the LAr TPC motherboards to be used in the
protoDUNE detector.

## Setup
The code here makes use of tools and other code in dunetpc, the 
repository that holds the DUNE TPC simulation and reconstruction code.
For instructions on obtaining that code, see
